# Antariksh Dwivedi - Personal Portfolio

A simple, clean personal portfolio website built with HTML (and soon CSS!).

This is my first real portfolio project — showcasing who I am, my skills, and my growing projects as a diploma student learning front-end development.

- Will add sections for:
  - About Me
  - Skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, AI tools like Claude & Antigravity)
  - My Projects (with links to GitHub repos)
  - Contact form/email
- Future version: Migrate to React for dynamic features!

This portfolio is a living document of my progress.
